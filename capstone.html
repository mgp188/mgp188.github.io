		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Montgomery Leadership Program is a three semester fellowship program at Mississippi State University that is committed to
		promoting the values of leadership and service.  Throughout the duration of the program, I have learned more about myself as a leader, my 
		strengths and weaknesses, and how I can best go about making a difference in my community.

		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In the third semester of this program, each fellow is tasked with brainstorming and implementing a Capstone Project.  For my
		Capstone project, I wanted to focus on giving back to the university that had given so much to me.  My plan was to make a new outdoor seating area
		for students and visitors alike behind our library.  In order to accomplish this, I needed both the permission to do this, and a way to raise funds
		for the tables and chairs.

		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp When it came to permissions, we needed both the approval of the library and the university's planning oommittee.  Starting off,
		the general idea was to provide seatingnd scenery for a newly constructed plaza area behind the library.  I quickly learned that this general idea
		would not be enough to convince the staff in these oversight positions, and that I would need something more concrete.  In order to accomplish this
		goal, I	worked with other classmates to take an overhead shot of the area with a drone and work up a rough blueprint of what we wanted with CAD
		software.  Having both evidence of the idea and of a solid work ethic eventually got the project approved by the required parties.

		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Once the project was approved, the focus shifted to fundraising at full force.  I began collaboration with multiple 
		restaurants such as Panda Express and McAlister's Deli to host fundraising nights at their restaurants.  To raise funds at McAlister's,
		I had to recruit classmates to help work at the restaurant at various time shifts between 4 and 9 PM.  For Panda Express, the focus fell
		primarily on advertisement, as the customer had to present a voucher for the funds to go the project.  These two opportunities presented
		unique challenges, and I learned a lot from both.  Unfortunately, these did not raise enough money for the project as a whole.  In order
		to compensate for this, I have decided to work to give the project legs of its own to move forward and continue raising funds on.  This 
		is currently taking the form of partnering with MSU Foundations to highliht the project to alumni as an opportunity to donate and give
		back to their past campus.	This portion of the project is still in progress.

		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I have learned a lot from my Capstone project throughout this semester.  In order to accomplish important things, you 
		have to be ahead of the game and invested in the entire process.  If I had not been prepared when talking to the library staff, it is likely
		that this project would have never started.  If I had not advertised and reached out to get the community involved in the process, the 
		fundraising nights would not have been effective, and we wouldn't have been able to contribute anything to the project.  I learned many lessons
		about communication and persistence in this field, as everyone is busy and in you have to show people you are willing to work for them
		if you are going to receive any of their valuable time.  Overall, this has been a great experience, and one that I hope to see fruit from soon.
