		<h1>A Brief Synopsis of Michael Poole:</h1>

		<br/>
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp My name is Michael Poole, and I am currently enrolled as an undergraduate as Mississippi State University.
		I am studying Computer Science, and have always had a passion for computers.  My grandfather was an electrical
		engineer, and throughout my childhood he would show me various neat tricks you could do with a computer.
		Seeing those unknown possibilities at such a young age opened my mind to the wonderful things I could do,
		and really gave me a passion for learning in general.

		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I have always been good at math, but at the same time have had quite the creative side.  This has very much
		led me to choose and enjoy Computer Science as my major, as I get to think critically, as math asks you to do, but also don't have
		to stick to the formula.  Computer programming gives me the ability to improvise, and truly think out the best way to solve a problem,
		rather than simply looking up the formula and going from there.  Throughout my schooling and work so far I have completed many 
		projects in Python, C#, and C++.  My areas of focus have been database management and front-end development, both of which I love.
		I have done full stack development for a C# windows app as well as quite a bit of web development, using HTML, javascript, PHP, and
		the	likes.

		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Outside of programming, I have kept myself quite busy with student involvement throughout my time at Mississippi
		State.  While I was in highschool, I never thought of myself as a student leader, and never had the intention or desire to be one.
		Ever since Freshman year at Mississippi State, this notion has changed drastically.  My Freshman year, I got dragged into the Freshman
		branch of the Student Association, and haven't been able to shake it yet.  The next year I became leader of that same Freshman Council,
		and began looking for other avenues to get involved.  I found Montgomery Leadership Program, Cru on-campus ministry, and the TEDx Student
		Organization among other organizations to become a part of and to help make a difference on campus through.  And ultimately, that is what
		it is all about for me - making a difference!  I used to believe that individuals did not have enough in them to make a difference on 
		their own.  What I failed to realize, however, is how inspiring individuals can be, and how many people around the community are willing 
		to help out a good cause.

		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I would consider myself to have an adventurous personality.  I enjoy experiencing new things, and don't like to get
		stuck in the same routine.  This also means that I thrive off of challenges, and being presented with the opportunity to learn new ideas
		and skill sets.  I believe that this has led me to have quite an eclectic array of influences in my life.  I try to see things and learn
		different viewpoints from all kinds of different people.  This allows me to keep from getting stuck in my ways and continue to grow and
		develop to be the best I can be.  The desire for adventure has also led me to travel quite a bit throughout college.  I have visited
		everywhere from the rain forests of Panama and the mountains of Peru to the scenery and studios of California.  I am quite an independent
		person, and have been described as one of the most extroverted introverts you could ever meet.  I believe this personality and willingness
		to learn from others helps me thrive in whatever situation in which I might be placed.
